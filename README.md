# Streamlit Graph App

This is a simple Streamlit application that displays a line chart generated using Altair.

## Description

The app generates random data and displays it as a line chart. It uses Streamlit for the user interface and Altair for creating the chart.

## Usage

To run this app, you need to have Streamlit installed. Since this environment does not support installing external packages, the chatbot functionality has been disabled.

1.  Make sure you have Streamlit installed.
2.  Run the app using the following command:

    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

## Libraries

*   Streamlit
*   Pandas
*   Numpy
*   Altair

## Note

The chatbot functionality, which originally used the `huggingface_hub` library, has been disabled due to the inability to install external packages in this environment.
